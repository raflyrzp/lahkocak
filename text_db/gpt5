Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a large language model released by OpenAI in 2020.

Like its predecessor, GPT-2, it is a decoder-only[2] transformer model of deep neural network, which supersedes recurrence and convolution-based architectures with a technique known as "attention".[3] This attention mechanism allows the model to focus selectively on segments of input text it predicts to be most relevant.[4] GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, each with 16-bit precision, requiring 350GB of storage since each parameter occupies 2 bytes. It has a context window size of 2048 tokens, and has demonstrated strong "zero-shot" and "few-shot" learning abilities on many tasks.[2]

On September 22, 2020, Microsoft announced that it had licensed GPT-3 exclusively. Others can still receive output from its public API, but only Microsoft has access to the underlying model.[5] 

According to The Economist, improved algorithms, more powerful computers, and a recent increase in the amount of digitized material have fueled a revolution in machine learning. New techniques in the 2010s resulted in "rapid improvements in tasks", including manipulating language.[6]

Software models are trained to learn by using thousands or millions of examples in a "structure ... loosely based on the neural architecture of the brain".[6] One architecture used in natural language processing (NLP) is a neural network based on a deep learning model that was introduced in 2017—the transformer architecture.[7] There are a number of NLP systems capable of processing, mining, organizing, connecting and contrasting textual input, as well as correctly answering questions.[8]

On June 11, 2018, OpenAI researchers and engineers published a paper introducing the first generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)—a type of generative large language model that is pre-trained with an enormous and diverse text corpus in datasets, followed by discriminative fine-tuning to focus on a specific task. GPT models are transformer-based deep-learning neural network architectures. Previously, the best-performing neural NLP models commonly employed supervised learning from large amounts of manually-labeled data, which made it prohibitively expensive and time-consuming to train extremely large language models.[2] The first GPT model was known as "GPT-1," and it was followed by "GPT-2" in February 2019. Created as a direct scale-up of its predecessor, GPT-2 had both its parameter count and dataset size increased by a factor of 10. It had 1.5 billion parameters, and was trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages.[9]

In February 2020, Microsoft introduced its Turing Natural Language Generation (T-NLG), which they claimed was "largest language model ever published at 17 billion parameters."[10] It performed better than any other language model at a variety of tasks, including summarizing texts and answering questions.
