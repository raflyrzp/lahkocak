Zen 5 is the name for a CPU microarchitecture by AMD, shown on their roadmap in May 2022,[3] launched for mobile in July 2024 and for desktop in August 2024.[4] It is the successor to Zen 4 and is currently fabricated on TSMC's N4X process.[5] Zen 5 is also planned to be fabricated on the N3E process in the future.[6]

The Zen 5 microarchitecture powers Ryzen 9000 series desktop processors (codenamed "Granite Ridge"), Epyc 9005 server processors (codenamed "Turin"),[7] and Ryzen AI 300 thin and light mobile processors (codenamed "Strix Point").[8]

Zen 5 was designed with both 4nm and 3nm processes in mind. This acted as an insurance policy for AMD in the event that TSMC's mass production of its N3 nodes were to face delays, significant wafer defect issues or capacity issues. One industry analyst estimated early N3 wafer yields to be at 55% while others estimated yields to be similar to those of N5 at between 60-80%.[13][14] Additionally, Apple, as TSMC's largest customer, is given priority access to the latest process nodes. In 2022, Apple was responsible for 23% of TSMC's $72 billion in total revenue.[15] After N3 began ramping at the end of 2022, Apple bought up the entirety of TSMC's early N3B wafer production capacity to fabricate their A17 and M3 SoCs.[16] Zen 5 desktop and server processors continue to use the N6 node for the I/O die fabrication.[17]

Zen 5 CCDs are fabricated on TSMC's N4X node which is intended to accommodate higher frequencies for high-performance computing (HPC) applications.[18] Zen 4-based mobile processors were fabricated on the N4P node which is targeted more towards power efficiency. N4X maintains IP compatibility with N4P and offers a 6% frequency gain over N4P at the same power but comes with the trade-off of moderate leakage.[19] Compared to the N5 node used to produce Zen 4 CCDs, N4X can enable up to 15% higher frequencies while running at 1.2V.[20]

The Zen 5 CCD, codenamed "Eldora", has a die size of 70.6mm2, a 0.5% reduction in area from Zen 4's 71mm2 CCD while achieving a 28% increase in transistor density due to the N4X process node.[21] Zen 5's CCD contains 8.315 billion transistors compared to the Zen 4 CCD's 6.5 billion transistors.[22] The size of an individual Zen 5 core is actually larger than a Zen 4 core but the CCD has been reduced via shrinking the L3 cache. The monolithic die used by "Strix Point" mobile processors, fabricated on TSMC's lower power N4P node, measures 232.5mm2 in area.[21]
