As the semiconductor industry continues to evolve, Arm stands at the forefront of innovation for its core and IP architecture, especially in the mobile space, by pushing the boundaries of technology to deliver cutting-edge solutions for end users. For 2024, Arm's year-on-year strategic advancements focus on enhancing last year's Armv9.2 architecture with a new twist. Arm has rebranded and re-strategized its efforts by introducing Arm Compute Subsystem (CSS), the direct successor to last year's Total Compute Solutions (TSC2023) platform.

Arm is also transitioning its latest IP and Cortex core designs, including the largest Cortex X925, the middle Cortex A725, and the refreshed and smaller Cortex A520 to the more advanced 3 nm process technology. Arm promises that the 3 nm process node will deliver unprecedented performance gains compared to last year's designs, power efficiency and scalability improvements, and new front and back-end refinements to its Cortex series of cores. Arms' new solutions look to power the next-generation mobile and AI applications as Arm, along with its complete AArch64 64-bit instruction execution and approach to solutions geared towards mobile and notebooks, look set to redefine end users' expectations within the Android and Windows on Arm products.

The introduction of Arm Compute Subsystem (CSS) marks a significant milestone in Arm's strategy to deliver a holistic and full-rounded computing solution for partners to implement in their new yearly cycle of mobile devices. CSS is a comprehensive platform that integrates hardware, software, and tools to optimize the performance and efficiency of client devices. It is designed to provide a seamless computing experience across various devices, from smartphones and tablets to laptops and even desktop PCs.

When launched last year, the Armv9.2 architecture represented a significant step forward in Arm's roadmap. Still, this year, it's about building on the successes of its predecessors while introducing a host of new features and improvements. One of the key highlights of the revamped Armv9.2 family is the use of enhanced security features, which include memory tagging extensions (MTE) and confidential compute architecture (CCA). These features provide robust protection against various security threats, making devices more secure.

CSS leverages the latest Armv9.2 cores designed for 2024, including the high-performance Cortex X925, the balanced Cortex A725, and the power-efficient and refreshed Cortex A520. These cores are complemented by Arm's new Immortalis G925 GPU, designed to deliver exceptional graphics performance and efficiency in a mobile-sized package. Together, these components form the foundation of what is now called the CSS platform, which aims to provide a powerful and versatile computing solution for modern devices in the mobile sphere.

One of CSS's key features is its robust scalability for different markets, such as mobile and notebooks. The platform is designed to scale across different device form factors and performance requirements, making it suitable for many tasks and applications. Whether it's high-end gaming, professional content creation, or everyday productivity tasks, CSS can be tailored to meet the needs of various use cases.

Arm's Arm Compute Subsystem (CSS) platform represents a significant step forward in IP design and architectural improvements, offering multiple and claiming serious levels of enhancements in performance and efficiency. With the introduction of the second-generation Armv9.2 Cortex CPU cluster, including the new Cortex-X925 (big), Cortex-A725 (middle), and a refreshed Cortex-A520 (little) cores, the CSS platform is designed to deliver the ultimate in mobile computing performance when licensed out to their partners.

Additionally, the CSS platform includes a comprehensive reference software stack for Android, optimized AI backed by new Arm computer vision libraries (KleidiAI and KleidiCV), and robust tooling environments through Arm Performance Studio. This typically holistic approach ensures that Arm's physical implementations achieve speeds greater than 3.6 GHz and offer optimal power, performance, and area (PPA) metrics on the 3 nm node. Speaking of the 3 nm mode, Arm stated that TSMC and Samsung 3 nm are the key options for their CSS core cluster, although it's most likely to be a case of getting fab allocations with TSMC as we are unsure if any will use Samsung over TSMC.

In addition to security enhancements, Armv9.2 on 3 nm also promises substantial performance improvements, especially with the new big core, the Cortex X925, which Arm believes is the new IPC king of the mobile. The architecture has been optimized for higher clock speeds and better levels of efficiency, which in turn should deliver more compute power per watt. This is achieved through several architectural innovations, including wider execution pipelines, improved branch prediction, and enhanced out-of-order execution capabilities. These enhancements boost the cores' Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), ensuring they can easily handle the most demanding workloads.
